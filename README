## What is this?
Demo code for a talk at Clojure/West 2012 called <i>Load Testing with Clojure</i>. The demo code consists of a simplistic mathematics server built with [Compojure](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure) and [Incanter](http://incanter.org/), some test functions using [clojure.test](http://richhickey.github.com/clojure/clojure.test-api.html), and [Grinder](http://grinder.sourceforge.net/) test scripts.
